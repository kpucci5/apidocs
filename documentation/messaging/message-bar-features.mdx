The **Draft with my AI** option will allow you to draft a variety of different types of content using the memories contained in your AI. In the message bar, you can use prompts such as "Draft me an email for..." or "Draft me an excerpt for the book I'm writing about..." or "Give me caption for my Instagram post about...". Once you've decided on a prompt for your draft, click the *Draft with my AI button* and within seconds you will notice a draft created inside the message bar.

### Draft AI Image[](#draft-ai-image)

The **Draft AI Image** option will allow you to convert natural language into an image. Begin typing a complex description in the message bar of what you want the image to be, click the Draft AI Image and within seconds your image will be created in the message bar. See the example picture below:

<img alt="Draft Image Output" classname="block dark:hidden" src="/images/bar-4.png" />

<img alt="Red Car" classname="block dark:hidden" src="/images/bar-5.png" />

The resulting image will be created along with an AI-generated description of the image.

### Describe my Image

The **Describe my Image** option generates an AI description of any image of your choosing. You can either upload an image using the file uploader next to the message bar, or paste an image into the message bar. Once you've selected your image, use the AI instructions button to select "Describe my Image". Within seconds and comprehensive description of the image you chose will be generated by AI. See the example below:

<img alt="Describe my Image Output" classname="block dark:hidden" src="/images/bar-7.png" />

<img alt="Dodgers Stadium" classname="block dark:hidden" src="/images/bar-8.png" />

### Ask ChatGPT[](#ask-chatgpt)

### Ask Google[](#ask-google)

Similar to "Ask ChatGPT", the Ask Google button will generate a response to your prompt directly from Google.

### More Messaging Bar Features[](#more-messaging-bar-features)

<img alt="Text Editor" classname="block dark:hidden" src="/images/bar-11.png" />

Our text editor can be located here on the messaging bar. This text editor can (from right to left) create the following: Bold Text, Text in Italics, and Underline Text. Formatting options include creating a bullet point list and a numbered list. You can also embed links, upload images from your computer, and send emoticons!

### Using Tags in Prompts or Messages

You can tag a person included in a channel by typing "@" followed by the person's name. When you type "@" in the messaging bar, you will notice a list of people to choose from, when you begin typing the name it will continue to filter the list. Then click on the name you want.[](#using-tags-in-prompts-or-messages)

You can also use tags in your prompt when talking to your AI. To make reference to specific documents included in your memory, use ":" followed by the title of the document. When you see the document name you want, click on it to make reference to it.

<img alt="Colon Delimiter" classname="block dark:hidden" src="/images/bar-13.png" />

Once you've selected the document title of your choosing, the reference in the message bar will look like this:

<img alt="Title Reference" classname="block dark:hidden" src="/images/bar-14.png" />

The exact same method works when making references to tags included in your documents. Just use "#" to make references to tags.
