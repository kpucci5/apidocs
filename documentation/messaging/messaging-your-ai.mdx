title: "Messaging your AI"
---

Think of messaging your AI as if you‚Äôre messaging a person instead of as if you are writing prompts to an AI.

Personal AI is designed to mimic your expressions with an AI version of you. The memories of a Personal AI are unique to each model and each person. Hence, try to adapt the mindset that you are talking to a person and messaging or prompting an individual.

### The Flow

Every personal AI message prompt is interpreted by your personal AI followed by consulting a public AI (ex: ChatGPT) when needed. Every AI response is expected to have a personal score.

The **personal score** is a measure of how accurate or personal the AI thinks its response is to you. The higher the score, the more confident the AI is that the answer it has provided could be coming from you. When you don‚Äôt have personal thoughts on a topic that is new to your AI, then the personal scores for that topic are expected to be lower.

## A question or statement with rich context will help your AI provide rich responses

You can be as specific or as vague as you want, but anything you leave out will ultimately be left out of the context of your AI‚Äôs response. Being vague is a great way to get variety, but you may not get what you‚Äôre looking for. If personal AI cannot understand or answer, similar to a human, their AI will construct its best possible synthesized response for you.

*Try to be as clear as possible about any context or details that are important to you.*

#### Example 1: Vague

**Prompt:** Define Personal AI

**Suman AI:** Personal AI is an AI that is designed for an individual. Personal AIs are often seen as the next step in personal computing.

#### Example 2: Specific

**Prompt:** Define Personal AI in the context of General AI

**Suman AI:** Personal AI is a type of AI that is specifically designed for an individual. This means that it takes into account the specific needs, preferences, and characteristics of that person in order to create a personalized experience. General AI, on the other hand, is a type of AI that is designed to be more general purpose and can be trained on large amounts of data.

### Resetting the conversation

Click on "New Convo" to clear the context of the chat. The actual messages populated in the given chat will not be erased. Sometimes, you may want to start a new conversation with your AI without any prior context. Clearing the conversation allows for a fresh start, especially when the previous conversation has concluded or if you want to switch topics.
