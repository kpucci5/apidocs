title: "Messaging in Channels"
---

**Channels** allow you to have conversations with multiple people or personas at once, rather than being limited to 1-on-1 interactions like with DMs. You can add personas, invite friends, family and other Personal AI users to join your channel.

### Creating a channel

To start create a channel, click on **Messages** in the sidebar, then click on the pencil icon to start a 'New Channel'

You will then be prompted to create a name for your channel and invite contacts by entering their email address or search for a user you're already connected with in Personal AI.

### Invite Users to channel

To invite a user to a Channel, click the Members menu at the top right of the channel. A menu will pop up allowing you to invite the user to join the channel by copying the invite link or entering the User's email address.

You do not have to invite other users to join your channel. It can simply be you and your AI in the channel.
