## Overview

Personal AI offers several controls for managing how your AI interacts in conversations, including Autopilot, Personal Score thresholds, Voice Responses, and Conversation Starters.

---
## **Autopilot and Personal Score**

When your AI is on **Autopilot**, it automatically sends responses. However, if a response falls below the **Personal Score** threshold you set, you will receive a **Copilot** message that you can edit and send manually.

- If the AI response is **above the threshold** (e.g., the threshold is set at 60% personal, and the response exceeds 60%), the message is sent automatically like any other Autopilot message.
- The **Personal Score** is customizable for each DM and channel, allowing you to adjust it in multiple places if necessary.

---
## **Voice Responses**

Voice responses can be toggled on and off for individual chats and direct messages. By default, this setting is managed by the Personal AI team, but you can turn it on for new DMs as needed.

---
## **Conversation Starters**

**Conversation Starters** are clickable prompts designed to help users know what to ask your AI. They appear directly above the chat bar in DMs and Channels when your AI is in Autopilot mode, offering quick suggestions to engage with the AI.
