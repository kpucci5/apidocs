# Enable Persona Chatting on Profile Page


- Persona Chatting on the Profile Page lets anyone start a conversation with your Personasâ€”no sign-up required.
- Once enabled, visitors to your Profile Page will see the option to "Public Chat."
- To turn this on, go to your Persona settings, click Configure, and navigate to the Publishing & Sharing section.
- From there, you can view your Profile Page and copy the link to share with others.

### Where do I manage public chat on my end?

Simply go to the "Public Chat" direct message under the "Messages" tab.&#x20;

From here, you can monitor the responses your AI sends out. You can simply edit a response and it will be edited on the users end.

Furthermore, just like in a normal DM with a contact, the settings you assign in this DM will work the same way. For example, if you change the AI mode to copilot, you will have to approve the response first. If you assign a personal score parameter, the user on the other end will only see a response when the answer is above the given personal score. Therefore if your AI is not responding, ensure the AI is on autopilot with no threshold.&#x20;
