# Memory Upload: URLs

The URLs option allows you to add web links for your AI to process and learn from.

**This upload method is good for:**

Articles, blog posts, research papers, or any online content that you want the AI to reference for future conversations.

To upload data from a URL, paste the URL in the **Enter a URL** block and click **Upload**.

<img alt="Upload URL" classname="block dark:hidden" src="/images/upload-url.gif" />

Uploading data from a URL

URLs must be singular URLs that contain the content needed. Overarching websites (e.g. nba.com) will not work. Avoid including headers and footers (this can be cleaned up later using the [training tools in the document editor](https://app.gitbook.com/o/nbVBaUyixnBYw8JgeVIt/s/dbMN7r709l6jIY1z4OHN/training-your-ai/training-tools-in-the-document-editor)).
