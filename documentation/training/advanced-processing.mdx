**CSV Spreadsheets**

Leverage advanced CSV processing for seamless data import and transformation. Here's how it works:&#x20;

1. Initial parsing is optimized for rapid data ingestion.

2. Data transformation cleans and normalizes the data.

3. Chunking and processing handle large files using stream and parallel processing.

4. The integration pipeline converts data into a vector database, generates embeddings for semantic search, and links related data.
