**What is the Upload Library?**

The **Upload Library** is a centralized space where you can view and manage all the uploads you've made for your various personas. Whether you're working with one persona or across many, the Upload Library helps you keep track of your uploads easily.

### **Key Features**

#### **Unified Upload History for Primary Persona**

* **All Uploads in One Place:** When using your **Primary Persona**, you'll be able to see every upload across all your personas. This provides a complete, unified view of everything you've uploaded, making it easier to manage all your uploads in one location. In the primary you can also filter by persona or personas giving you full control over the history.&#x20;

#### **Persona-Specific Upload History**

* **Focused View for Each Persona:** When working within a specific persona (other than the Primary), the **Upload History** only shows uploads tied to that individual persona. This allows you to focus on content that’s directly relevant to that persona.

* **No Overlap:** Uploads from other personas won’t appear here, ensuring a clean and persona-specific view.

#### **Filtering Options**

You can filter your uploads by:

* **All:** Displays every upload or draft associated with the persona you're currently working in.

* **In Memory:** Shows uploads that have been added to memory.

* **Drafts:** Lists uploads that were not added to memory (ex: if you X out of a document it will turn into a draft)

#### **Upload Dates for Easy Tracking**

You can easily see the **upload date** for each item in the Upload Library, making it simple to track when a file was uploaded and find recent uploads.

**Search Bar**

Use the **search bar** to quickly find older uploads by searching for the **title** of the document. This makes it easy to locate specific uploads, even if they were added a while ago.
