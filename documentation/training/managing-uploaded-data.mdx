# How to Manage Uploaded Data


Once data is uploaded using the Files, URLs, Text or Media option, you can view and manage it in the **Upload History** at the bottom of each area or in the [**Upload Library**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/nbVBaUyixnBYw8JgeVIt/s/dbMN7r709l6jIY1z4OHN/training-your-ai/upload-library).&#x20;
