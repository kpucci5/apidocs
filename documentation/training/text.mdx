# Memory Upload: Text


The Text option allows you to manually enter text to be stored in your AIâ€™s memory.

This upload method is good for:
Journal entries, summaries, custom notes, or specific instructions that you want the AI to reference during interactions.

To upload using the Text option, click the **New Text Upload**\*\* button. A text editor will appear, allowing you to type or paste your desired text.

To increase the recall accuracy of your AI, add relevant tags. Tags are used by your AI to categorize memory within the document. When a keyword is used in a prompt that matches a tag in a set of documents, the AI will focus on these documents to generate an answer which is how the accuracy is improved.

Adding tags to documents

You can also add this document to the memory of other personas by using the **Assign Persona** feature. To do this, click on the menu icon on the top right of the screen, then click **Assign Persona**. From there, you can choose the personas whose memory you want this data saved to.
