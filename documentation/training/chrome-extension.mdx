### **Using the Personal AI Chrome Extension**

Before you begin saving your URLs or uploading files to specific personas, you first need to connect the Chrome extension to Personal AI by adding your API key and a Persona domain name.

* Here’s how it works. Start by navigating to your account setting in Personal AI.

* Locate your API Key close to the bottom of the page. Your API key will look something like this: AIzaSyCwEro-FHowsjfe-DyJp3t2E

* Copy this API Key and paste it into the field saying “API Key” in your Chrome extension.

* Next, you need to locate your Persona Domain Name for the specific Persona you want to save the URL or upload files to. Don’t worry, you only need to complete this step once per persona and the Chrome extension will save the information for the next time you browse the web.

* You do this by clicking “Publishing & Sharing” under the Configure tab in Personal AI.

* Once you are in the Publishing & Sharing tab, locate the “Brand Page Link” section.

* For example: If I would like to save a URL page or upload a file to the “VP of Strategy, Marcus” persona, I would copy the domain “tjxcompanies-marcus.personal.ai” and paste only the “tjxcompanies-marcus” into the field “Domain Name” in the chrome extension.

* Once you are done copying and pasting the API Key and Persona domain name into the Chrome extension, it should look like this:

* Remember to press “Save Settings” before you exit the settings page.

* If you would like to add multiple personas to the extension, you simply need to copy and paste their Persona domain name into the domain name field. Press the “+” sign to add multiple personas at one time. Always remember to “Save Settings” before exiting the settings page.

* You are now ready to save URLs and upload files directly from your Google Chrome browser to your Personal AI Persona!

### **Saving to Your AI Memory: Save URL**

* Whenever you browse the web and find something you would like to save, simply click our logo in the Chrome extension section to “Save URL”.

* If you have added multiple personas to the extension, you can choose which one you want to save it to by choosing from the list in the “Select a Persona” dropdown menu.

* There will be pre-populated titles and hashtags when you add a new URL. If you want to modify either of them, you can edit directly in the Chrome extension before saving to your AI memory.

* To add your own tags, simply type in the tag field and hit enter/return on your keyboard for each new tag.

* Once you are done adding tags and selecting your Persona, make sure to hit the “Save to Memory” button. You will be met with this screen, indicating that your file has been successfully saved:

* You now have the option to return back to the upload screen or go to Personal AI to see your new memory.

### **Saving to Your AI Memory: Upload Files**

* With our Chrome extension, you can also drag and drop any file to quickly save to your AI Memory while browsing the web.

* Similarly to the upload URL function, you can select which persona you want to save the file to by choosing from the list in the “Select a Persona” dropdown menu.
