* **Persona Guidance** is a resource to help guide you to get the most out of this type of Persona. They are not settings that affect your Persona.

* The **Persona Directive** allows you to create multiple custom directives for your persona. This is useful for deploying the persona across different channels with unique instructions. You'll also be able to enable it in Persona DMs, allowing workspace users to have tailored interactions based on the directive set for them.
