Channel directives are specific instructions or guidelines that you can set for your AI within individual channels. They work by customizing how your AI behaves and responds in that particular channel, allowing you to tailor its personality, knowledge, and communication style for different audiences, purposes, or use cases.&#x20;

## **How To Create a Channel Directive**

* To create a channel directive, go to your Persona settings and select "Train" at the top of your screen.

* Make sure your Persona Identity is set to “Custom”.

To add a new channel directive, scroll down past your Persona’s custom directive until you see the “Channel Directives” section.&#x20;

* Once you are in the “Channel Directive” section, you can name and describe new channel directives.&#x20;

* The smaller boxes are where you name the channel directive which defines its purpose and focus. For example, in the image above, there are two different channel directives: "Email Drafts" and "Financial Research". It's beneficial to name your channel directives as you'll be able to select between them once in the channels later.&#x20;

* The larger boxes are where you describe the actual channel directive. These are the specific instructions that you want your channel to follow. Make sure to give clear guidelines and provide detailed roles and responsibilities.&#x20;

\*\*Note that only the channel owner can create and change channel directives.&#x20;



## **How To Switch Between Different Channel Directives**

Once you have finished defining the channel directives in your Persona settings, locate your channels to pick which specific directive you want your channel to follow.

* Start by pressing the Persona icon at the top right of your channel. This will give you a dropdown menu of different channel settings (see below).

* When pressing “Channel Directive”, you will see a new dropdown menu displaying the different channel directives you’ve created. As mentioned earlier, it is great to name your channel directives as they will be displayed in this list making it easier to distinguish them from each other.
