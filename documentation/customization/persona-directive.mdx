title: "Persona Directives"
---

Persona Directives are alternate instruction sets that adjust how a single persona responds across different channels or DMsâ€”without needing to create new personas.

- To create or edit **persona directives**, go to **Persona Settings** under the **Training Studio** tab.
- For example, if you have a custom directive set for a Store Productivity Analyst Persona, you can add additional instructions under Persona Directives by scrolling down in the Persona Settings.
- These can be deployed in **DMs** and **Channels** depending on the audience the persona is intended for or the task it needs to handle there.

- In DMs, you can assign a **different Persona directive** to each workspace member based on their role and engagement needs with the AI.

- In **Channels**, these directives are useful if you want to customize each persona's directive based on the purpose of the channel or the audience engaging in it.
- Enable this by clicking on the **AI Control** menu in the top right corner, then click **Default AI**, and scroll down to select which persona custom directive to apply.
