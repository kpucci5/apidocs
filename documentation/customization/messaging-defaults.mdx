The **Messaging Defaults** section allows you to customize the interaction style and behavior of your AI persona in chats and channels.


**Default AI**
- This setting will make the Persona the default AI in new messages and channels. 

**AI Mode**
- AI Mode sets the default mode your AI will be on when you or others engage with your AI in Direct Message or Public Chat.
- **Autopilot**: Setting your AI Mode to Autopilot means your AI will automatically respond to users' prompts.
- **Copilot**: Setting your AI Mode to Copilot means your AI will draft a response for you but will not automatically respond until you approve and send the message.
- You can also control the AI Mode for individual chats and channels. Changes made to AI Mode within a chat or channel only apply to that specific chat or channel.

**AI Response Threshold**
- Set the default AI response threshold for this persona in new workspaces, persona DMs, and new owned channels. The threshold determines whether a response is sent; if it doesn't meet the set threshold, it won't be sent.

**Preset Welcome Message**
- A preset welcome message is the first message other users will see when they enter Public Chat or engage in a Direct Message with your AI.

**Fallback Auto-Reply**
- Fallback Auto-Reply defines the default response when the AI doesn't know an answer or it provides a low-confidence reply (personal score).

**Default Voice Response Setting**
- Default Voice Response allows you to enable or disable the voice response feature for Copilot and Autopilot messages. You can also toggle Voice Response on and off inside each individual chat and direct message. Changes made to Voice Response within a chat or channel only apply to that specific chat or channel.

**Reference Documents in Persona DMs**
- Allow workspace members to reference a specific document upload when chatting with this persona in Persona DMs using the colon command. This helps narrow the conversation to one document (e.g., “Tell me about :Q4 Financials”).

**DM Name Display Preference**
- Choose whether your profile name and picture, or the name and photo of this AI persona when it is assigned to a DM, are displayed when sending messages in a DM and in the DM preview. This setting applies to both new and existing DM conversations.

**Conversation Starter Preference**
- Decide how conversation starters function when clicked for this persona. “Send Immediately” will start the conversation with the pre-written prompt right away. “Edit Before Sending” will fill the message bar with the starter text, allowing you to modify it before sending.
