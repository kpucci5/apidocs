Under Persona Settings > Configure > Publishing & Sharing, you can choose your privacy settings to make your persona either discoverable in your workspace or accessible by invite only.

- **Invite Only**: Only people you explicitly invite can view and interact with your persona. It won’t appear throughout your workspace when people search for Personas.

- **Shared**: Your persona is discoverable to others in your workspace. When someone searches in "DM Persona," they’ll be able to find and direct message the persona.
