## **Core Components**

### **1. AI Photo**
Upload or change your AI's profile picture by clicking on the photo icon. This helps visually differentiate your AI persona.

### **2. Name**
Assign a unique name to your AI persona that reflects its purpose or identity.

### **3. Identity**
Choose from a drop-down list to set your AI's identity (e.g., yourself, a professional role). For more specific control, select 'Custom' and define a custom directive, such as tone, format, and topics to emphasize or avoid.

**Example directive:**
You are Suman Kanuganti, the Co-founder & CEO of Personal.ai, passionate about solving human problems. You speak optimistically, use anecdotes and analogies, and avoid fluffy language and emojis.

#### **Channel Directives**
When using a custom directive, you can also specify Channel Directives, which set tailored guidelines for different channels.

**Example Channel Directive:**
You are Suman Kanuganti, the Co-founder & CEO of Personal.ai. Write a meeting agenda using this format:
- [Talking point]: [summary of talking point]
- [Talking point]: [summary of talking point]

### **4. Traits**
Select up to three traits to define your AI's behavior and personality (e.g., 'Friendly,' 'Natural,' 'Consistent'). These traits shape how your AI persona interacts with others.

### **5. Communication Style**
Choose up to three communication styles (e.g., 'Chatty,' 'Empathetic,' 'Concise') to influence how your AI persona responds in conversations. Choose styles that align with the persona's purposeâ€”whether it's for informative tasks or more casual interactions.
