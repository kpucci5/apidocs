* There, you can modify a user's role in the middle section. Use the drop-down menus to transfer ownership or switch their role between Manager and Collaborator.

* Additionally, a workspace owner or admin can reassign Persona ownership when removing a user who currently owns it.

* A pop-up window will appear, warning that this action is irreversible and that the user will lose the ability to oversee this Persona.
