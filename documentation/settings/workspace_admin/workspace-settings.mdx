**Workspace Settings**

The Personal AI Workspace includes three roles:

* **Workspace Owners** are the highest-level administrators who have complete control over the workspace. They manage the organization's structure, billing, and have full administrative powers. Think of them as the workspace's executive leadership - they make critical decisions about workspace configuration and user management.

* **Workspace Admins** serve as day-to-day managers who help maintain and organize the workspace. While they can't handle billing or make top-level decisions, they have significant control over member management and workspace customization. They're like team leaders who ensure smooth operations without having financial responsibilities.

* **Workspace Members** are the standard users who can participate in channels, communicate with others, and manage their own created content. They focus on collaboration and communication within the workspace but don't have administrative privileges. Think of them as team members who contribute to the workspace's activities without management responsibilities.

Each role is designed to create a clear hierarchy of responsibilities while maintaining security and proper access control within the workspace.
