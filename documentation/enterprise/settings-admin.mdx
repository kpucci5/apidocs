Workspace Admins serve as day-to-day managers who help maintain and organize the workspace. While they can't handle billing or make top-level decisions, they have significant control over member management and workspace customization. They're like team leaders who ensure smooth operations without having financial responsibilities.

- Under **Personal Settings**, you can manage your profile settings, including your name, email address, API key, accessibility options, and the option to delete your account.

- Under **Organizational Settings**, you can manage **Workspace Management** settings, including the workspace name and logo. Unlike Owners, Admins **cannot** see the option to transfer the workspace to another user or delete the workspace from this section.

- Under **Organizational Settings**, you can manage **People** settings, where you can view members' names, email addresses, and their roles within the workspace.

- From there, you can add new members and assign them a role using the dropdown menu. The available roles are **Owner**, **Admin**, and **Member**.

- You can also update these roles later from the **People** settings page if you need to make any changes.
