# Settings for Workspace Owners


Workspace Owners are the highest-level administrators who have complete control over the workspace. They manage the organization's structure, billing, and have full administrative powers. Think of them as the workspace's executive leadership - they make critical decisions about workspace configuration and user management.

- Under **Personal Settings**, you can manage your profile settings, including your name, email address, API key, accessibility options, and the option to delete your account.

- Under **Organizational Settings**, you can manage **Workspace Management** settings, including the workspace name, logo, and the option to transfer the workspace to another user. You can also delete the workspace from this section.
