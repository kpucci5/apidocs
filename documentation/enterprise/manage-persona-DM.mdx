From there, you can adjust settings such as enabling or disabling reply on mention, changing the default message, managing fallback suggestions, and toggling voice response. (Hover over the "i" symbol for more information about each setting.)

* You can also adjust the AI response by dragging the slider to control the response when the personal score differs.
