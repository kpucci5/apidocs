**Collaborate on Persona**&#x20;

* If you want to allow another user to collaborate on a Persona you own, you can add them as a collaborator.

* To invite a collaborator, hover over your Persona and click the three dots in the top-right corner. Then, select "Share Persona" to send an invitation.

* There, you can choose to assign the user as either a **Collaborator** or a **Manager** for your Persona.

* Hover over the "i" symbol to view the permissions for each role:

  * **Manager**: Can train the Persona, send messages, modify settings, and add or remove other managers and collaborators.

  * **Collaborator**: Can contribute by uploading training content and interact with the Persona through messaging.
