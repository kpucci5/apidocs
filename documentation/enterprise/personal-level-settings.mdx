title: "Permissions: Persona-Level Settings"

* **Owner Role** serves as the ultimate authority for a Persona. They have full control over all aspects including critical decisions about configuration, access management, and Persona development. Their purpose is to maintain strategic control and ensure the Persona aligns with organizational goals.

* **Manager Role** functions like a team leader who handles day-to-day operations. They can train the AI, manage basic settings, and coordinate with collaborators. Their purpose is to maintain regular Rersona operations without having access to critical system changes, making them ideal for departmental or project-level management.

* **Collaborator Role** operates as a content contributor with basic access rights. They can help train the AI and view interactions but cannot change settings or manage others. Their purpose is to allow broader team participation in persona development while maintaining security through limited permissions.

This three-tier structure ensures efficient workflow management while protecting sensitive persona functions and maintaining clear accountability at each level.
