description: Settings For Workspace Members

Workspace Members are the standard users who can participate in channels, communicate with others, and manage their own created content. They focus on collaboration and communication within the workspace but don't have administrative privileges. Think of them as team members who contribute to the workspace's activities without management responsibilities.

- Under **Personal Settings**, you can manage your profile settings, including your name, email address, API key, accessibility options, and the option to delete your account.
