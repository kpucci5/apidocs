### Channel Settings - Default AI

- From here, you can select which AI should be the **default AI** for the channel.
- Below, you can manage the default AI's response settings, including **Autopilot, Co-pilot, or Off**, and enable or disable features such as **reply on mention, default messages, fallback suggestions, and voice responses**.  
- Additionally, you can adjust the **AI response threshold**, which determines whether the Persona should respond based on the personal score. If the score does not meet the set threshold, the AI will fall back to a preset message instead of generating a response.
