 </Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is Personal AI's Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and how does it work?>

We use Google Cloud IDS as our primary intrusion detection system, providing automated threat detection and intrusion monitoring across our Google Cloud Platform infrastructure that hosts all Personal AI services. Our IDS integrates seamlessly with our broader security stack, including Virtual Private Cloud for network protection, Google Cloud Monitoring for alerts, Twingate for secure remote access, and Auth0 for identity management. It's critical for early threat detection, maintaining SOC 2 compliance, and protecting PII data for our 25 employees and thousands of users - especially important following our recent lounge security incident. Our IT/Engineering team actively monitors the IDS environment as part of our overall security posture and incident response procedures.
