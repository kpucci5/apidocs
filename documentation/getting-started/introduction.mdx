## **Core Components**

### **AI Personas**
Each persona is a distinct AI identity with its own:

#### **2. Continuous Training (Mobile/WebApp)**
- Save messages to AI memory
- Edit and improve AI responses
- Real-time learning through interactions

### **Interaction Modes**
- **Autopilot**: AI responds automatically to queries
