**1. AI Mode**

Comment

AI Mode sets the default mode your AI will be on when you or others engage with your AI in Direct Message or Public Chat.&#x20;

* **Autopilot**: Setting your AI Mode to Autopilot means your AI will automatically respond to users' prompts.
  Comment

* **Copilot**: Setting your AI Mode to Copilot means your AI will draft a response for you but will not automatically respond until you approve and send the message.

You can also control the AI Mode for individual chats and channels. Changes made to AI Mode within a chat or channel only apply to that specific chat or channel.



**2. Preset Welcome Message**

A preset welcome message is the first message other users will see when they enter Public Chat or engage in a Direct Message with your AI.&#x20;

e.g. "Hi, I'm Christine Ha. Have you seen me on MasterChef or want to know about a recipe?"

**3. Fallback Auto-Reply**

Fallback Auto-Reply defines the default response when the AI doesn't know an answer or it provides a low-confidence reply (personal score).



**4. Default Voice Response Setting**

Default Voice Response allows you to enable or disable the voice response feature for Copilot and Autopilot messages. You can also toggle Voice Response on and off inside each individual chat and direct message. Changes made to Voice Response within a chat or channel only apply to that specific chat or channel.
