## **Core Components**
Personal AI's API platform consists of two fundamental APIs: Ingestion and Inference. The Ingestion API handles data input, allowing organizations to feed proprietary information into the AI system. The Inference API enables real-time interactions with trained AI models, facilitating dynamic and intelligent engagement with users.

### **Multi-Modal Support**
The platform supports various types of interactions and data inputs, enabling diverse communication methods across different channels. This includes:
- Text-based conversations
- Document processing
- Knowledge base integration
- Custom data formats
Organizations can configure which modalities to enable based on their specific needs.

### **AI Personas**
AI personas are customizable agents that represent specific roles or expertise within your organization. Each persona can be:
- Trained on specialized knowledge
- Configured with specific behavioral patterns
- Assigned custom voice and interaction styles
- Updated and modified as needed
Personas maintain consistent brand voice while providing expert-level interactions in their designated domains.

### **Privacy & Security**
The platform implements a privacy-first approach with:
- End-to-end data encryption
- Secure data storage and processing
- Customizable access controls
- Compliance with privacy regulations
All data remains under organizational control, with options for data retention and deletion policies.
